                <h2>Playing While Growing Up</h2>
                <p>I have played soccer my whole life, however my competetive playing days were from 
                age six until age eighteen (the end of my senior year of high school). From ages 6-10, I only 
                played House League, which was for local kids in my neighborhood to play each other. My dad was 
                my coach, and although we were often really bad, it was always a good time. I played every fall and spring, 
                and often did summer camps as well at this age. When I was going into the fourth grade, I tried out for 
                my first club team, the Chicago Edge. I was bad at this point, so I was on the lowest team for ten year olds 
                the next year. Regardless, it was a lot of fun. As always, I was on the same team as my twin brother, 
                and I would like to believe that playing together made us closer, even from a young age.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                I started playing club soccer more competitively in eighth grade. At this point, me and my twin brother had outgrown 
                the coaching and playing level of Chicago Edge. My brother and I moved to a club called Chicago Blast, which was located a little west of us 
                outside of the city. The playing level and coaching was instantly better. The first year was good, if not intense with the step-up 
                in level of play, but the second year was not fantastic. We then switched to a club located in the city that played at a super high level, and 
                remained there for the rest of high school, winning often. This club was called Chicago Blues. Throughout high school, we played for our school's 
                team, St. Ignatius College Prep. Playing for our school was fun, as we played with our friends, but the coaching was always poor and the level of play was 
                inconsistent.

                <h2>
                Following Soccer
                </h2>
                <p>
                My main interest in following soccer started when I was around ten years old. My dad took me and my brother to see our local 
                MLS team play against Tottenham Hotspur, from London. At this point, I did not follow any sports, but I decided that my team 
                of choice for following European soccer would be Tottenham. Thus began my drawn-out interest in Tottenham, European soccer, and 
                everything related. I have followed Tottenham every season since then, through the highs and (mostly) lows, but there is a special feeling 
                about watching your team play that I think most sports fans understand. While I have never lived in Europe 
                and may never understand the cult following that local teams command there, I have done my best to engage in fanbases abroad and connect with 
                other Tottenham fans. It also helps that my twin brother feels the same about Tottenham as I do. I consume as much soccer media as I can, usually on <a
                target="_blank" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/">this site</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                A big part about following soccer is following one's national team. This is less true for American fans of European teams, as 
                the American team has never really been able to compete with other large countries. However, my father is an immigrant from Croatia, and as a result, my 
                ancestry played a much larger part in my development than for others who's families immigrated well before mine did. In Croatia, the national team is the pride 
                and joy of the country, and everything in the country grinds to a halt when Croatia play a big game. The same was true in my household growing up, and national team players 
                are all household names.

                <h2>
                Playing Casually and Coaching
                </h2>
                <p>
                Since graduating high school, I no longer play soccer competitively, however I relish every chanve I get to play and attempt 
                to make that happen as often as possible. Immediately after graduating, I spent the summer playing on a local field with my brother and sister 
                at least once a week, as simply kicking a ball around without any match structure is still very fun for me. As soon as I got to college, I wanted to play 
                intramural soccer with my friends, so I made a team with some of the guys in my dorm freshman year. That was fun while it lasted, although it only continued up 
                until fall break. I played when home again with my siblings, and intramural in the spring, but not as often until meeting some older guys in the Chicago area 
                who play pickup on Sunday mornings and holidays like Thanksgiving. Every time I go home, my brother and I makea  point of playing with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                I have always been interested in leadership in sports, but not necessarily from a players' position. My first experience coaching was during my sophomore year of 
                high school. My older brother was a soccer coach at my school at the time, and he was the girls' JV coach that season. His team did not have any trained goalies on it. I 
                have played goalie my whole life and was not bad. I was certainly good enough to train a novice in some basics, so he brought me on board to do that a couple times a week. I absolutely loved that experience. 
                My next coaching task was in my senior year of high school, where I coached youth soccer at a local club a handful of times, however that was far less a soccer job and more of a 
                camp counselor job. Still, I loved being around the sport in any capacity, and to this day love teaching others about it.
