        <h1>Go play frisbee, I guess.</h1>
        <p>I don't play frisbee, but it seems like a good time. My roommates play frisbee and they have fun.</p>
        <p>They take it super seriously. Here are there highlights:</p>

        <p>You should play their intramurals, it is a great fundraiser.</p>
        <p>I have to say, coming from someone who played soccer growing up, the culture around frisbee is fantastic.
             People are always super supportive of one another, and there is far less toxicity.

        <p>Go to their website if you want to play. Look up USC Men's Ultimate.</p>
